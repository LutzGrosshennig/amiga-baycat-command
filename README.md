# amiga-baycat-command
An Amiga top down endless scrolling game project started in 1989. 

Some friends of me (back then) where really talented with graphics and we started a couple of really promising game projects including this one.

The story is kind of lame: You and your speed boot against time and bandits! Of course with 50 FPS smooth as silk vertical scrolling.

One of the tile sets:

I cant recall exactly why we abandoned the project but we gradually diverged. Other projects from this area are "Dungeons" (a serial link co-op dungeon game) and "Ballerspiel" a horizontal scrolling game.
which will come to github as well.

Unfortunatly we never had any good sounds and the time to finish Baycat Command. So what is still missing?

* Enemies!
* Sounds!
* Levels!

Due to the crappy IRQ initialization it currently requires Kickstart 1.2/1.3!

Have fun with it!
